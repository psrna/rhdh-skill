# RHDH release SoS check-in

Produce the cumulative release check-in a Scrum of Scrums call needs: where the
release sits on the calendar, which checklist rows are due today, and the Jira
counts behind them. Read-only — the report is copied into the meeting; nothing is
posted.

## Route

Load `workflows/sos-report.md`. The runbook lives in `references/sos-checks.md`;
timeline rules in `references/timeline.md`; output shape in
`references/report-format.md`.

## Boundary with the neighbouring skills

- Milestone dates on their own — `/rhdh-release-schedule`.
- Ad-hoc counts without the SoS runbook — `/rhdh-release-status`.
- Team roster and Slack handles — `/rhdh-release-teams`.
- Slack freeze announcements — `/rhdh-release-announce`.
- Rich Filter setup prose — `/rhdh-release-status` (`references/config.md` there).

Query execution reuses the `/rhdh-release-status` scripts through
`scripts/_release_bridge.py`; install both skills together.

## Completion

Complete when the user receives `report_markdown` from the CLI unchanged: metadata
table, milestone table, and one Checks row per due check with summary and Jira link,
plus a team sub-row under each check with per-team summary and Jira link.
Nothing was posted to Slack or Jira.
